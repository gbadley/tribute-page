            <h2>The History of the Raptors Championship Season:</h2>
            <p>The 2018–19 Toronto Raptors season was the 24th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). During 
                the off-season, the Raptors acquired small forward Kawhi Leonard from the San Antonio Spurs after trading 
                franchise star DeMar DeRozan. The season ended with the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance 
                and first NBA championship, ending the city's and the country's 26-year Big Four championship drought.</p>
            <h2>The Playoff Run:</h2>    
            <p>In the playoffs, the Raptors defeated the Orlando Magic in five games in the first round. They edged the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games in the semifinals to make their 
                first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2016, with Kawhi Leonard's buzzer beater over Joel Embiid giving the Raptors a 92–90 victory 
                in the series-clinching game 7. The series was a rematch of the 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals, where 
                the Allen Iverson-led 76ers defeated the Vince Carter-led Raptors in seven games. 
                The Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals 4–2, winning the last four games 
                of the series after being down 0–2 to become the sixth team to overcome that deficit. 
                They won the Finals against the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, also the first 
                NBA Finals series that was played outside the United States. They beat the Warriors 4–2, becoming the first 
                team based in Canada to win the NBA title.[4] The Raptors were the first Atlantic Division team since 
                the 2007–08 Boston Celtics and the first Eastern Conference team since the 2015–16 Cleveland Cavaliers 
                to win the championship. Prior to the Raptors victory, the Atlantic Division had had the second longest 
                title drought in the league. The Northwest Division will hold the record for having the longest championship 
                drought of all divisions in the league, with the 1978–79 Seattle Supersonics being the last champion. This 
                is also Toronto's first major sports championship since the Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series.</p>
